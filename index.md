<p><b>American Aedes vexans Mosquitoes are Competent Vectors of Zika Virus</b> <i>Alex Gendernalik1, James Weger-Lucarelli1, Selene M. Garcia Luna1, Joseph R. Fauver1, Claudia Rückert1, Reyes A. Murrieta1, Nicholas Bergren1, Demitrios Samaras1, Chilinh Nguyen1, Rebekah C. Kading1, Gregory D. Ebel1</i>
Starting in 2013–2014, the Americas have experienced a massive outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) which has now reached at least 49 countries. Although most cases have occurred in South America and the Caribbean, imported and autochthonous cases have occurred in the United States. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes are known vectors of ZIKV. Little is known about the potential for temperate Aedes mosquitoes to transmit ZIKV. Aedes vexans has a worldwide distribution, is highly abundant in particular localities, aggressively bites humans, and is a competent vector of several arboviruses. However, it is not clear whether Ae. vexans mosquitoes are competent to transmit ZIKV. To determine the vector competence of Ae. vexans for ZIKV, wild-caught mosquitoes were exposed to an infectious bloodmeal containing a ZIKV strain isolated during the current outbreak. Approximately 80% of 148 mosquitoes tested became infected by ZIKV, and approximately 5% transmitted infectious virus after 14 days of extrinsic incubation. These results establish that Ae. vexans are competent ZIKV vectors. Their relative importance as vectors (i.e., their vectorial capacity) depends on feeding behavior, longevity, and other factors that are likely to vary in ecologically distinct environments.</P>
				
<p><b>Serosurvey of Crimean–Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus in Cattle, Mali, West Africa</b> <i>Authors: Ousmane Maiga1, Miriam Andrada Sas2, Kyle Rosenke3, Badian Kamissoko5, Marc Mertens2, Nafomon Sogoba1, Abdallah Traore5, Modibo Sangare6, Mamadou Niang5, Tom G. Schwan4, Hamidou Moussa Maiga6, Sekou F. Traore1, Heinz Feldmann3,8, David Safronetz7,8, Martin H</i> Groschup2 Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever is a tick-borne disease caused by the arbovirus Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV, family Bunyaviridae, genus Nairovirus). CCHFV can cause a severe hemorrhagic fever with high-case fatality rates in humans. CCHFV has a wide geographic range and has been described in around 30 countries in the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and Africa including Mali and neighboring countries. To date, little is known about the prevalence rates of CCHFV in Mali. Here, using banked bovine serum samples from across the country, we describe the results of a seroepidemiological study for CCHFV aimed at identifying regions of circulation in Mali. In total, 1,074 serum samples were tested by a modified in-house CCHFV-IgG-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with confirmatory testing by commercial ELISA and immunofluorescence assay. Overall, 66% of samples tested were positive for CCHFV-specific IgG antibodies. Regional seroprevalence rates ranged from 15% to 95% and seemed to correlate with cattle density. Our results demonstrate that CCHFV prevalence is high in many regions in Mali and suggest that CCHFV surveillance should be established.</p>

<p><b>Susceptibility of Florida Mosquitoes to Infection with Chikungunya Virus</b> <i>Michael H. Reiskind1, Kendra Pesko1, Catherine J. Westbrook1, Christopher N. Mores1</I> Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has caused recent, large epidemics on islands in the Indian Ocean, raising the possibility of more widespread CHIKV epidemics. Historically, CHIKV has been vectored by Aedes aegypti, but these outbreaks likely also involved Ae. albopictus. To examine the potential for an outbreak of CHIKV in Florida, we determined the susceptibility to CHIKV of F1 Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus from Florida. In addition, we also evaluated two well-characterized laboratory strains (Rockefeller and Lake Charles) of these species. We determined infection and dissemination rates as well as total body titer of mosquitoes 7 days post-exposure (pe) (Ae. albopictus) and 3, 7, and 10 days pe (Ae. aegypti). All mosquito strains were susceptible to both infection and dissemination, with some variation between strains. Our results suggest Florida would be vulnerable to transmission of CHIKV in urban and rural areas where the two vector species occur.</p>

<p><b>Sand fly population dynamics and cutaneous leishmaniasis among soldiers in an Atlantic forest remnant in northeastern Brazil</b><i> Filipe Dantas-Torres, Kamila Gaudêncio da Silva Sales, Débora Elienai de Oliveira Miranda, Fernando José da Silva, Luciana Aguiar Figueredo, Fábio Lopes de Melo, Maria Edileuza Felinto de Brito, Maria Sandra Andrade, Sinval Pinto Brandão-Filho.</i> Outbreaks of cutaneous leishmaniasis are relatively common among soldiers involved in nocturnal activities in tropical forests. We investigated the population dynamics of sand flies in a military training camp located in a remnant of Atlantic rainforest in northeastern Brazil, where outbreaks of cutaneous leishmaniasis have sporadically been described. From July 2012 to July 2014, light traps were monthly placed in 10 collection sites, being nine sites located near the forest edge and one near a sheep and goat stable. Light traps operated from 5:00 pm to 6:00 am, during four consecutive nights. Leishmania infection in sand flies was assessed using a fast real-time PCR assay. Cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis among soldiers were also investigated. In total, 24,606 sand flies belonging to 25 species were identified. Males (n = 12,683) predominated over females (n = 11,923). Sand flies were present during all months, being more numerous in March (n = 1,691) and April 2013 (n = 3,324). Lutzomyia choti (72.9%) was the most abundant species, followed by Lutzomyia longispina (13.8%), Lutzomyia complexa (5.3%), representing together >90% of the sand flies collected. Forty cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis were recorded among soldiers from January 2012 to December 2014. Leishmania isolates were obtained from eight patients and were all characterized as Leishmania braziliensis. Soldiers and anyone overnighting in Atlantic rainforest remnants should adopt preventative measures such as the use of repellents on bare skin or clothes and insecticide-treated tents.</P>

<p><b>Risk analysis and prediction of visceral leishmaniasis dispersion in São Paulo State, Brazil.</b><i> Anaiá da Paixão Sevá, Liang Mao, Fredy Galvis-Ovallos, Joanna Marie Tucker Lima, Denis Valle.</i> Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important neglected disease caused by a protozoan parasite, and represents a serious public health problem in many parts of the world. It is zoonotic in Europe and Latin America, where infected dogs constitute the main domestic reservoir for the parasite and play a key role in VL transmission to humans. In Brazil this disease is caused by the protozoan Leishmania infantum chagasi, and is transmitted by the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis. Despite programs aimed at eliminating infection sources, the disease continues to spread throughout the Country. VL in São Paulo State, Brazil, first appeared in the northwestern region, spreading in a southeasterly direction over time. We integrate data on the VL vector, infected dogs and infected human dispersion from 1999 to 2013 through an innovative spatial temporal Bayesian model in conjunction with geographic information system. This model is used to infer the drivers of the invasion process and predict the future progression of VL through the State. We found that vector dispersion was influenced by vector presence in nearby municipalities at the previous time step, proximity to the Bolívia-Brazil gas pipeline, and high temperatures (i.e., annual average between 20 and 23°C). Key factors affecting infected dog dispersion included proximity to the Marechal Rondon Highway, high temperatures, and presence of the competent vector within the same municipality. Finally, vector presence, presence of infected dogs, and rainfall (approx. 270 to 540mm/year) drove the dispersion of human VL cases. Surprisingly, economic factors exhibited no noticeable influence on disease dispersion. Based on these drivers and stochastic simulations, we identified which municipalities are most likely to be invaded by vectors and infected hosts in the future. Prioritizing prevention and control strategies within the identified municipalities may help halt the spread of VL while reducing monitoring costs. Our results contribute important knowledge to public and animal health policy planning, and suggest that prevention and control strategies should focus on vector control and on blocking contact between vectors and hosts in the priority areas identified to be at risk.</p>

<p><b>Genetic evidence for a worldwide chaotic dispersion pattern of the arbovirus vector, Aedes albopictus.</b><i> Mosè Manni, Carmela R. Guglielmino, Francesca Scolari, Anubis Vega-Rúa, Anna-Bella Failloux, Pradya Somboon, Antonella Lisa, Grazia Savini, Mariangela Bonizzoni, Ludvik M. Gomulski, Anna R. Malacrida, Giuliano Gasperi.</i> Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito is the most invasive species in the world. Over the past 30 years, from its native tropical Southeast Asia it rapidly spread across the world, and it is currently present in several tropical, subtropical and temperate countries due to its high ecological plasticity. Its dramatic global expansion has resulted in public health concerns as a consequence of its vector competence for several arboviruses, such as chikungunya, dengue and Zika, which are the most prevalent pathogens of humans. The identification of the migration routes and, consequently, the demographic origin of mosquito adventive populations is a priority to prevent local outbreaks of viral infection. Using a combined population genetics and Bayesian approach, we found that the worldwide invasion of this mosquito has not occurred through a step-by-step expansion process from the native Southeast Asia. A recent and chaotic human-mediated propagule distribution allowed adventive populations to be established in the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Basin, and North America regions. We have detected high intra-population variability, which may co-operate with the genetic mechanisms controlling vector competence.</p>

		<p> <b>Sharp, P. M., and B. H. Hahn. 2011. Origins of HIV and the AIDS pandemic. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 1:a006841</b> Researchers looked at the origin of HIV and SIV viruses, the factors that enabled cross-species transmission of the viruses, and the host related barriers to cross-species transmission. HIV-1 group M, the strain causing the global aids pandemic, originated from a chimpanzee SIV virus in southeast Cameroon. While there is evidence that SIV viruses have been present in primates for over 30,000 years, HIV originated in the early 1900s. HIV-1 emerged at a time when urban populations were expanding. There are several barriers to cross-species transmission, including the host restriction factor tetherin. SIV viruses attack tetherin’s cytoplasmic domain. Because that method is ineffective in humans, HIV-1 evolved to attack tetherin’s membrane-spanning domain. HIV-1 M’s ability to fully attack tetherin in this way may be why it is the only group to achieve pandemic status.</p>

Crameri, D. Quammen, D. Jordan, P. Freeman, L.-F. Wang, J. H. Epstein, G. A. Marsh, N. Y. Kung, and H. McCallum. 2015. Ecological dynamics of emerging bat virus spillover. Proc. Biol. Sci. 282:20142124.</b> Bats play important roles as reservoir hosts in many emerging zoonotic viruses. Researchers focused on the ecological causes of spill over events between bats and humans/domestic animals. In order for spill over to occur, bats must be infected, they must be shedding virus in large enough numbers, the virus must be able to survive outside the bats, domestic animals must have contact with bat excretions, and the animals must be susceptible to the virus. Research has shown that bats shed virus particles in “pulses” where viral shedding in an area is greatly increased during a certain period of time. The researchers present two hypotheses for this. The episodic shedding hypothesis states that when bats are stressed, their immune system is weakened and they shed a greater number of virus particles. The transient epidemics hypothesis states that as immunity to a certain virus decreases over generations, a new pool of susceptible bats can become infected and shed the virus. Restoring bat habitat and food sources along with restricting domestic animals from grazing in areas near bats may decrease the chance of spillover.</p>

Biodiversity inhibits parasites: Broad evidence for the dilution effect. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 112:8667–8671.</b> In the past few decades, biodiversity has been decreasing and the number of infectious disease outbreaks has been increasing. The dilution effect hypothesis posits that these two occurrences may be linked considering biodiversity in host communities inhibits the spread of parasites. By conducting a meta-analysis, researchers found strong evidence that the dilution effect influences both parasites and herbivores (associational resistance). Because the dilution effect influences herbivores as well as parasites, it may also influence other host/prey relationships. Researchers found that dilution effects were dependent on the host frequency rather than density, and that the dilution effect did not depend on any specific ecological factors, such as the lifecycle of the parasite or the host type (wildlife vs. humans). Researchers conclude that preserving biodiversity may be a potential strategy in limiting the number and severity of infectious disease outbreaks.</p>
			<p><b>Johnson PTJ, Preston DL, Hoverman JT, Richgels KLD. Biodiversity decreases disease through predictable changes in host community competence. Nature 2013; 494(7436): 230-3.</b> There is increasing evidence that biodiversity may decrease the prevalence of infectious disease. However, this dilution effect hypothesis remains controversial as there is little evidence directly linking species diversity and disease risk. The theory behind the dilution effect states that as species diversity increases through the addition of species with low host competency, disease risk decreases. However, researchers have pointed out that if species richness increases by adding species with high host competency, there may be an increase in disease risk rather than a decline. Using experiments and field data, researchers provide empirical evidence that species diversity limits the spread of a virus in amphibian communities. Communities with high diversity had a smaller proportion of species with high host competency and a reduced infection rate. Researchers also found evidence that amphibian species diversity, the amount of infected snails, and the amount of infected amphibians were linked. Because of this, the researchers concluded that future studies should access ecological factors such as vectors and intermediate hosts when evaluating the dilution effect in a community.</P>
