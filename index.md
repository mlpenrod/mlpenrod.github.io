<p><b>American Aedes vexans Mosquitoes are Competent Vectors of Zika Virus</b> <i>Alex Gendernalik1, James Weger-Lucarelli1, Selene M. Garcia Luna1, Joseph R. Fauver1, Claudia Rückert1, Reyes A. Murrieta1, Nicholas Bergren1, Demitrios Samaras1, Chilinh Nguyen1, Rebekah C. Kading1, Gregory D. Ebel1</i>
Starting in 2013–2014, the Americas have experienced a massive outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) which has now reached at least 49 countries. Although most cases have occurred in South America and the Caribbean, imported and autochthonous cases have occurred in the United States. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes are known vectors of ZIKV. Little is known about the potential for temperate Aedes mosquitoes to transmit ZIKV. Aedes vexans has a worldwide distribution, is highly abundant in particular localities, aggressively bites humans, and is a competent vector of several arboviruses. However, it is not clear whether Ae. vexans mosquitoes are competent to transmit ZIKV. To determine the vector competence of Ae. vexans for ZIKV, wild-caught mosquitoes were exposed to an infectious bloodmeal containing a ZIKV strain isolated during the current outbreak. Approximately 80% of 148 mosquitoes tested became infected by ZIKV, and approximately 5% transmitted infectious virus after 14 days of extrinsic incubation. These results establish that Ae. vexans are competent ZIKV vectors. Their relative importance as vectors (i.e., their vectorial capacity) depends on feeding behavior, longevity, and other factors that are likely to vary in ecologically distinct environments.</P>
				
<p><b>Serosurvey of Crimean–Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus in Cattle, Mali, West Africa</b> <i>Authors: Ousmane Maiga1, Miriam Andrada Sas2, Kyle Rosenke3, Badian Kamissoko5, Marc Mertens2, Nafomon Sogoba1, Abdallah Traore5, Modibo Sangare6, Mamadou Niang5, Tom G. Schwan4, Hamidou Moussa Maiga6, Sekou F. Traore1, Heinz Feldmann3,8, David Safronetz7,8, Martin H</i> Groschup2 Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever is a tick-borne disease caused by the arbovirus Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV, family Bunyaviridae, genus Nairovirus). CCHFV can cause a severe hemorrhagic fever with high-case fatality rates in humans. CCHFV has a wide geographic range and has been described in around 30 countries in the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and Africa including Mali and neighboring countries. To date, little is known about the prevalence rates of CCHFV in Mali. Here, using banked bovine serum samples from across the country, we describe the results of a seroepidemiological study for CCHFV aimed at identifying regions of circulation in Mali. In total, 1,074 serum samples were tested by a modified in-house CCHFV-IgG-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with confirmatory testing by commercial ELISA and immunofluorescence assay. Overall, 66% of samples tested were positive for CCHFV-specific IgG antibodies. Regional seroprevalence rates ranged from 15% to 95% and seemed to correlate with cattle density. Our results demonstrate that CCHFV prevalence is high in many regions in Mali and suggest that CCHFV surveillance should be established.</p>

<p><b>Susceptibility of Florida Mosquitoes to Infection with Chikungunya Virus</b> <i>Michael H. Reiskind1, Kendra Pesko1, Catherine J. Westbrook1, Christopher N. Mores1</I> Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has caused recent, large epidemics on islands in the Indian Ocean, raising the possibility of more widespread CHIKV epidemics. Historically, CHIKV has been vectored by Aedes aegypti, but these outbreaks likely also involved Ae. albopictus. To examine the potential for an outbreak of CHIKV in Florida, we determined the susceptibility to CHIKV of F1 Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus from Florida. In addition, we also evaluated two well-characterized laboratory strains (Rockefeller and Lake Charles) of these species. We determined infection and dissemination rates as well as total body titer of mosquitoes 7 days post-exposure (pe) (Ae. albopictus) and 3, 7, and 10 days pe (Ae. aegypti). All mosquito strains were susceptible to both infection and dissemination, with some variation between strains. Our results suggest Florida would be vulnerable to transmission of CHIKV in urban and rural areas where the two vector species occur.</p>

		<p> <b>Sharp, P. M., and B. H. Hahn. 2011. Origins of HIV and the AIDS pandemic. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 1:a006841</b> Researchers looked at the origin of HIV and SIV viruses, the factors that enabled cross-species transmission of the viruses, and the host related barriers to cross-species transmission. HIV-1 group M, the strain causing the global aids pandemic, originated from a chimpanzee SIV virus in southeast Cameroon. While there is evidence that SIV viruses have been present in primates for over 30,000 years, HIV originated in the early 1900s. HIV-1 emerged at a time when urban populations were expanding. There are several barriers to cross-species transmission, including the host restriction factor tetherin. SIV viruses attack tetherin’s cytoplasmic domain. Because that method is ineffective in humans, HIV-1 evolved to attack tetherin’s membrane-spanning domain. HIV-1 M’s ability to fully attack tetherin in this way may be why it is the only group to achieve pandemic status.</p>

Sci. 282:20142124.</b> Bats play important roles as reservoir hosts in many emerging zoonotic viruses. Researchers focused on the ecological causes of spill over events between bats and humans/domestic animals. In order for spill over to occur, bats must be infected, they must be shedding virus in large enough numbers, the virus must be able to survive outside the bats, domestic animals must have contact with bat excretions, and the animals must be susceptible to the virus. Research has shown that bats shed virus particles in “pulses” where viral shedding in an area is greatly increased during a certain period of time. The researchers present two hypotheses for this. The episodic shedding hypothesis states that when bats are stressed, their immune system is weakened and they shed a greater number of virus particles. The transient epidemics hypothesis states that as immunity to a certain virus decreases over generations, a new pool of susceptible bats can become infected and shed the virus. Restoring bat habitat and food sources along with restricting domestic animals from grazing in areas near bats may decrease the chance of spillover.
