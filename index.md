<p><b>American Aedes vexans Mosquitoes are Competent Vectors of Zika Virus</b> <i>Alex Gendernalik1, James Weger-Lucarelli1, Selene M. Garcia Luna1, Joseph R. Fauver1, Claudia Rückert1, Reyes A. Murrieta1, Nicholas Bergren1, Demitrios Samaras1, Chilinh Nguyen1, Rebekah C. Kading1, Gregory D. Ebel1</i>
Starting in 2013–2014, the Americas have experienced a massive outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) which has now reached at least 49 countries. Although most cases have occurred in South America and the Caribbean, imported and autochthonous cases have occurred in the United States. Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes are known vectors of ZIKV. Little is known about the potential for temperate Aedes mosquitoes to transmit ZIKV. Aedes vexans has a worldwide distribution, is highly abundant in particular localities, aggressively bites humans, and is a competent vector of several arboviruses. However, it is not clear whether Ae. vexans mosquitoes are competent to transmit ZIKV. To determine the vector competence of Ae. vexans for ZIKV, wild-caught mosquitoes were exposed to an infectious bloodmeal containing a ZIKV strain isolated during the current outbreak. Approximately 80% of 148 mosquitoes tested became infected by ZIKV, and approximately 5% transmitted infectious virus after 14 days of extrinsic incubation. These results establish that Ae. vexans are competent ZIKV vectors. Their relative importance as vectors (i.e., their vectorial capacity) depends on feeding behavior, longevity, and other factors that are likely to vary in ecologically distinct environments.</P>
				
<p><b>Serosurvey of Crimean–Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus in Cattle, Mali, West Africa</b> <i>Authors: Ousmane Maiga1, Miriam Andrada Sas2, Kyle Rosenke3, Badian Kamissoko5, Marc Mertens2, Nafomon Sogoba1, Abdallah Traore5, Modibo Sangare6, Mamadou Niang5, Tom G. Schwan4, Hamidou Moussa Maiga6, Sekou F. Traore1, Heinz Feldmann3,8, David Safronetz7,8, Martin H</i> Groschup2 Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever is a tick-borne disease caused by the arbovirus Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV, family Bunyaviridae, genus Nairovirus). CCHFV can cause a severe hemorrhagic fever with high-case fatality rates in humans. CCHFV has a wide geographic range and has been described in around 30 countries in the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and Africa including Mali and neighboring countries. To date, little is known about the prevalence rates of CCHFV in Mali. Here, using banked bovine serum samples from across the country, we describe the results of a seroepidemiological study for CCHFV aimed at identifying regions of circulation in Mali. In total, 1,074 serum samples were tested by a modified in-house CCHFV-IgG-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with confirmatory testing by commercial ELISA and immunofluorescence assay. Overall, 66% of samples tested were positive for CCHFV-specific IgG antibodies. Regional seroprevalence rates ranged from 15% to 95% and seemed to correlate with cattle density. Our results demonstrate that CCHFV prevalence is high in many regions in Mali and suggest that CCHFV surveillance should be established.</p>

<p><b>Susceptibility of Florida Mosquitoes to Infection with Chikungunya Virus</b> <i>Michael H. Reiskind1, Kendra Pesko1, Catherine J. Westbrook1, Christopher N. Mores1</I> Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has caused recent, large epidemics on islands in the Indian Ocean, raising the possibility of more widespread CHIKV epidemics. Historically, CHIKV has been vectored by Aedes aegypti, but these outbreaks likely also involved Ae. albopictus. To examine the potential for an outbreak of CHIKV in Florida, we determined the susceptibility to CHIKV of F1 Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus from Florida. In addition, we also evaluated two well-characterized laboratory strains (Rockefeller and Lake Charles) of these species. We determined infection and dissemination rates as well as total body titer of mosquitoes 7 days post-exposure (pe) (Ae. albopictus) and 3, 7, and 10 days pe (Ae. aegypti). All mosquito strains were susceptible to both infection and dissemination, with some variation between strains. Our results suggest Florida would be vulnerable to transmission of CHIKV in urban and rural areas where the two vector species occur.</p>

<p><b>Sand fly population dynamics and cutaneous leishmaniasis among soldiers in an Atlantic forest remnant in northeastern Brazil</b><i> Filipe Dantas-Torres, Kamila Gaudêncio da Silva Sales, Débora Elienai de Oliveira Miranda, Fernando José da Silva, Luciana Aguiar Figueredo, Fábio Lopes de Melo, Maria Edileuza Felinto de Brito, Maria Sandra Andrade, Sinval Pinto Brandão-Filho.</i> Outbreaks of cutaneous leishmaniasis are relatively common among soldiers involved in nocturnal activities in tropical forests. We investigated the population dynamics of sand flies in a military training camp located in a remnant of Atlantic rainforest in northeastern Brazil, where outbreaks of cutaneous leishmaniasis have sporadically been described. From July 2012 to July 2014, light traps were monthly placed in 10 collection sites, being nine sites located near the forest edge and one near a sheep and goat stable. Light traps operated from 5:00 pm to 6:00 am, during four consecutive nights. Leishmania infection in sand flies was assessed using a fast real-time PCR assay. Cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis among soldiers were also investigated. In total, 24,606 sand flies belonging to 25 species were identified. Males (n = 12,683) predominated over females (n = 11,923). Sand flies were present during all months, being more numerous in March (n = 1,691) and April 2013 (n = 3,324). Lutzomyia choti (72.9%) was the most abundant species, followed by Lutzomyia longispina (13.8%), Lutzomyia complexa (5.3%), representing together >90% of the sand flies collected. Forty cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis were recorded among soldiers from January 2012 to December 2014. Leishmania isolates were obtained from eight patients and were all characterized as Leishmania braziliensis. Soldiers and anyone overnighting in Atlantic rainforest remnants should adopt preventative measures such as the use of repellents on bare skin or clothes and insecticide-treated tents.</P>

<p><b>Risk analysis and prediction of visceral leishmaniasis dispersion in São Paulo State, Brazil.</b><i> Anaiá da Paixão Sevá, Liang Mao, Fredy Galvis-Ovallos, Joanna Marie Tucker Lima, Denis Valle.</i> Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important neglected disease caused by a protozoan parasite, and represents a serious public health problem in many parts of the world. It is zoonotic in Europe and Latin America, where infected dogs constitute the main domestic reservoir for the parasite and play a key role in VL transmission to humans. In Brazil this disease is caused by the protozoan Leishmania infantum chagasi, and is transmitted by the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis. Despite programs aimed at eliminating infection sources, the disease continues to spread throughout the Country. VL in São Paulo State, Brazil, first appeared in the northwestern region, spreading in a southeasterly direction over time. We integrate data on the VL vector, infected dogs and infected human dispersion from 1999 to 2013 through an innovative spatial temporal Bayesian model in conjunction with geographic information system. This model is used to infer the drivers of the invasion process and predict the future progression of VL through the State. We found that vector dispersion was influenced by vector presence in nearby municipalities at the previous time step, proximity to the Bolívia-Brazil gas pipeline, and high temperatures (i.e., annual average between 20 and 23°C). Key factors affecting infected dog dispersion included proximity to the Marechal Rondon Highway, high temperatures, and presence of the competent vector within the same municipality. Finally, vector presence, presence of infected dogs, and rainfall (approx. 270 to 540mm/year) drove the dispersion of human VL cases. Surprisingly, economic factors exhibited no noticeable influence on disease dispersion. Based on these drivers and stochastic simulations, we identified which municipalities are most likely to be invaded by vectors and infected hosts in the future. Prioritizing prevention and control strategies within the identified municipalities may help halt the spread of VL while reducing monitoring costs. Our results contribute important knowledge to public and animal health policy planning, and suggest that prevention and control strategies should focus on vector control and on blocking contact between vectors and hosts in the priority areas identified to be at risk.</p>

<p><b>Genetic evidence for a worldwide chaotic dispersion pattern of the arbovirus vector, Aedes albopictus.</b><i> Mosè Manni, Carmela R. Guglielmino, Francesca Scolari, Anubis Vega-Rúa, Anna-Bella Failloux, Pradya Somboon, Antonella Lisa, Grazia Savini, Mariangela Bonizzoni, Ludvik M. Gomulski, Anna R. Malacrida, Giuliano Gasperi.</i> Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito is the most invasive species in the world. Over the past 30 years, from its native tropical Southeast Asia it rapidly spread across the world, and it is currently present in several tropical, subtropical and temperate countries due to its high ecological plasticity. Its dramatic global expansion has resulted in public health concerns as a consequence of its vector competence for several arboviruses, such as chikungunya, dengue and Zika, which are the most prevalent pathogens of humans. The identification of the migration routes and, consequently, the demographic origin of mosquito adventive populations is a priority to prevent local outbreaks of viral infection. Using a combined population genetics and Bayesian approach, we found that the worldwide invasion of this mosquito has not occurred through a step-by-step expansion process from the native Southeast Asia. A recent and chaotic human-mediated propagule distribution allowed adventive populations to be established in the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Basin, and North America regions. We have detected high intra-population variability, which may co-operate with the genetic mechanisms controlling vector competence.</p>

<p><b>Landscape, Climate and Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome Outbreaks.</b><i> Prist, P.R., D´Andrea, P.S. & Metzger, J.P. EcoHealth (2017).</i>  We performed a literature review in order to improve our understanding of how landscape and climate drivers affect HCPS outbreaks. Anthropogenic landscape changes such as forest loss, fragmentation and agricultural land uses are related with a boost in hantavirus reservoir species abundance and hantavirus prevalence in tropical areas, increasing HCPS risk. Additionally, higher precipitation, especially in arid regions, favors an increase in vegetational biomass, which augments the resources for reservoir rodents, also increasing HCPS risk. Although these relationships were observed, few studies described it so far, and the ones that did it are concentrated in few places. To guide future research on this issue, we build a conceptual model relating landscape and climate variables with HCPS outbreaks and identified research opportunities. We point out the need for studies addressing the effects of landscape configuration, temperature and the interaction between climate and landscape variables. Critical landscape thresholds are also highly relevant, once HCPS risk transmission can increase rapidly above a certain degree of landscape degradation. These studies could be relevant to implement preventive measures, creating landscapes that can mitigate disease spread risk.</p>

<p><b>Could Malaria Control Programmes be Timed to Coincide with Onset of Rainfall?</b><i> Komen, K. EcoHealth (2017) 14: 259.</i> Malaria cases in South Africa’s Northern Province of Limpopo have surpassed known endemic KwaZulu Natal and Mpumalanga Provinces. This paper applies statistical methods: regression analysis and impulse response function to understand the timing of impact and the length that such impacts last. Climate data (rainfall and temperature) are obtained from South African Weather Services (SAWs); global data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), while clinical malaria data came from Malaria Control Centre in Tzaneen (Limpopo Province). Data collected span from January 1998 to July 2007. Signs of the coefficients are positive for rainfall and temperature and negative for their exponents. Three out of five independent variables consistently maintain a very high statistical level of significance. The coefficients for climate variables describe an inverted u-shape: parameters for the exponents of rainfall (−0.02, −0.01, −0.02, −0.00) and temperature (−46.61, −47.46, −48.14, −36.04) are both negative. A one standard deviation rise in rainfall (rainfall onset) increases malaria cases, and the effects become sustained for at least 3 months and conclude that onset of rainfall therefore triggers a ‘malaria season’. Malaria control programme and early warning system should be intensified in the first 3 months following the onset of rainfall.</p>

<p><b>High Prevalences and a Wide Genetic Diversity of Simian Retroviruses in Non-human Primate Bushmeat in Rural Areas of the Democratic Republic of Congo.</b><i> Steve, AM., Ahidjo, A., Placide, MK. et al. EcoHealth (2017) 14: 100.</i>Like the majority of emerging infectious diseases, HIV and HTLV are of zoonotic origin. Here we assess the risk of cross-species transmissions of their simian counterparts, SIV and STLV, from non-human primates (NHP) to humans in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). A total of 331 samples, derived from NHP bushmeat, were collected as dried blood spots (DBS, n = 283) or as tissue samples (n = 36) at remote forest sites mainly in northern and eastern DRC. SIV antibody prevalences in DBS were estimated with a novel high throughput immunoassay with antigens representing the actual known diversity of HIV/SIV lineages. Antibody-positive samples were confirmed by PCR and sequence analysis. Screening for STLV infection was done with universal primers in tax, and new strains were further characterized in LTR. SIV and STLV infection in tissue samples was done by PCR only. Overall, 5 and 15.4% of NHP bushmeat was infected with SIV and STLV, respectively. A new SIV lineage was identified in Allen’s swamp monkeys (Allenopithecus nigroviridis). Three new STLV-1 subtypes were identified in Allen’s swamp monkeys (Allenopithecus nigroviridis), blue monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis), red-tailed guenons (Cercopithecus ascanius schmidti) and agile mangabeys (Cercocebus agilis). SIV and STLV prevalences varied according to species and geographic region. Our study illustrates clearly, even on a small sample size from a limited number of geographic areas, that our knowledge on the genetic diversity and geographic distribution of simian retroviruses is still limited and that humans continue to be exposed to relative high proportions on infected NHP bushmeat.</p>

<p><b>The complex relationship between weather and dengue virus transmission in Thailand</b><i>  Campbell KM, Lin CD, Iamsirithaworn S, Scott TW.  Am J Trop Med Hyg 2013 89(6): 1066–1080.</i> Using a novel analytical approach, weather dynamics and seasonal dengue virus transmission cycles were profiled for each Thailand province, 1983–2001, using monthly assessments of cases, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. We observed systematic differences in the structure of seasonal transmission cycles of different magnitude, the role of weather in regulating seasonal cycles, necessary versus optimal transmission “weather-space,” basis of large epidemics, and predictive indicators that estimate risk. Larger epidemics begin earlier, develop faster, and are predicted at Onset change-point when case counts are low. Temperature defines a viable range for transmission; humidity amplifies the potential within that range. This duality is central to transmission. Eighty percent of 1.2 million severe dengue cases occurred when mean temperature was 27–29.5°C and mean humidity was > 75%. Interventions are most effective when applied early. Most cases occur near Peak, yet small reductions at Onset can substantially reduce epidemic magnitude. Monitoring the Quiet-Phase is fundamental in effectively targeting interventions pre-emptively.</p>

<p><b> CHANGES IN SEROPREVALENCE OF WEST NILE VIRUS ACROSS ILLINOIS IN FREE-RANGING BIRDS FROM 2001 THROUGH 2004 </b><i>Beveroth TA, Ward MP, Lampman RL, Ringia AM, Novak RJ. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2006;74(1): 174-179.</i> Of the 5,236 birds sampled for antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV) in Illinois from 2001 through 2004, 348 (6.6%) birds were seropositive. Our multiple year surveillance identified several avian species that had particularly high percentages of seropositive individuals. The importance of these species in the enzootic and/or epizootic transmission of WNV is discussed relative to their regional abundance and literature on host competency. The species with the highest exposure rates to WNV differed both temporally and regionally. In general, birds that bred or were born in Illinois were more likely to have antibodies than transient birds. There was also a significant difference in the seroprevalence between adults (12.1%) and juveniles (5.5%), indicating that the acquired antibody response from previous years is a critical concern when interpreting seroprevalence rates in wild-caught birds. The most common hosts for St. Louis encephalitis virus were also the most common hosts for WNV, which strongly supports the role of similar vectors for both flaviviruses. Avian species with high WNV seroprevalence rates tended to be those that bred throughout the year, have open cup nests, and live in close proximity to humans.</p>

<p><b> Regional Differences in the Association Between Land Cover and West Nile Virus Disease Incidence in Humans in the United States </b><i>Bowden SE, Magori K, Drake JM. Am J Trop Med Hyg 2011;84(2):234–238.</i> West Nile virus (WNV) is generally considered to be an urban pathogen in the United States, but studies associating land cover and disease incidence, seroprevalence, or infection rate in humans, birds, domesticated and wild mammals, and mosquitoes report varying and sometimes contradictory results at an array of spatial extents. Human infection can provide insight about basic transmission activity; therefore, we analyzed data on the incidence of WNV disease in humans to obtain a comprehensive picture of how human disease and land cover type are associated across the United States. Human WNV disease incidence in Northeastern regions was positively associated with urban land covers, whereas incidence in the Western United States was positively associated with agricultural land covers. We suggest that these regional associations are explained by the geographic distributions of prominent WNV vectors: Culex pipiens complex (including Cx. pipiens and Cx. quinquefasciatus) in the Northeast and Cx. tarsalis in the Western United States.</P>

		<p> <b>Sharp, P. M., and B. H. Hahn. 2011. Origins of HIV and the AIDS pandemic. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 1:a006841</b> Researchers looked at the origin of HIV and SIV viruses, the factors that enabled cross-species transmission of the viruses, and the host related barriers to cross-species transmission. HIV-1 group M, the strain causing the global aids pandemic, originated from a chimpanzee SIV virus in southeast Cameroon. While there is evidence that SIV viruses have been present in primates for over 30,000 years, HIV originated in the early 1900s. HIV-1 emerged at a time when urban populations were expanding. There are several barriers to cross-species transmission, including the host restriction factor tetherin. SIV viruses attack tetherin’s cytoplasmic domain. Because that method is ineffective in humans, HIV-1 evolved to attack tetherin’s membrane-spanning domain. HIV-1 M’s ability to fully attack tetherin in this way may be why it is the only group to achieve pandemic status.</p>

Crameri, D. Quammen, D. Jordan, P. Freeman, L.-F. Wang, J. H. Epstein, G. A. Marsh, N. Y. Kung, and H. McCallum. 2015. Ecological dynamics of emerging bat virus spillover. Proc. Biol. Sci. 282:20142124.</b> Bats play important roles as reservoir hosts in many emerging zoonotic viruses. Researchers focused on the ecological causes of spill over events between bats and humans/domestic animals. In order for spill over to occur, bats must be infected, they must be shedding virus in large enough numbers, the virus must be able to survive outside the bats, domestic animals must have contact with bat excretions, and the animals must be susceptible to the virus. Research has shown that bats shed virus particles in “pulses” where viral shedding in an area is greatly increased during a certain period of time. The researchers present two hypotheses for this. The episodic shedding hypothesis states that when bats are stressed, their immune system is weakened and they shed a greater number of virus particles. The transient epidemics hypothesis states that as immunity to a certain virus decreases over generations, a new pool of susceptible bats can become infected and shed the virus. Restoring bat habitat and food sources along with restricting domestic animals from grazing in areas near bats may decrease the chance of spillover.</p>

Biodiversity inhibits parasites: Broad evidence for the dilution effect. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 112:8667–8671.</b> In the past few decades, biodiversity has been decreasing and the number of infectious disease outbreaks has been increasing. The dilution effect hypothesis posits that these two occurrences may be linked considering biodiversity in host communities inhibits the spread of parasites. By conducting a meta-analysis, researchers found strong evidence that the dilution effect influences both parasites and herbivores (associational resistance). Because the dilution effect influences herbivores as well as parasites, it may also influence other host/prey relationships. Researchers found that dilution effects were dependent on the host frequency rather than density, and that the dilution effect did not depend on any specific ecological factors, such as the lifecycle of the parasite or the host type (wildlife vs. humans). Researchers conclude that preserving biodiversity may be a potential strategy in limiting the number and severity of infectious disease outbreaks.</p>
			<p><b>Johnson PTJ, Preston DL, Hoverman JT, Richgels KLD. Biodiversity decreases disease through predictable changes in host community competence. Nature 2013; 494(7436): 230-3.</b> There is increasing evidence that biodiversity may decrease the prevalence of infectious disease. However, this dilution effect hypothesis remains controversial as there is little evidence directly linking species diversity and disease risk. The theory behind the dilution effect states that as species diversity increases through the addition of species with low host competency, disease risk decreases. However, researchers have pointed out that if species richness increases by adding species with high host competency, there may be an increase in disease risk rather than a decline. Using experiments and field data, researchers provide empirical evidence that species diversity limits the spread of a virus in amphibian communities. Communities with high diversity had a smaller proportion of species with high host competency and a reduced infection rate. Researchers also found evidence that amphibian species diversity, the amount of infected snails, and the amount of infected amphibians were linked. Because of this, the researchers concluded that future studies should access ecological factors such as vectors and intermediate hosts when evaluating the dilution effect in a community.</P>

Linking deforestation to malaria in the Amazon: characterization of the breeding habitat of the principal malaria vector, Anopheles darlingi. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 81:5–12.</b> Previous research has linked deforestation to increasing outbreaks of malaria. Researchers collected larvae from locations with varying degrees of deforestation in the Amazon and identified the mosquito species when the larvae matured. Researchers analyzed the relationship between the presence of Anopheles darlingi, the species known to be the most significant malaria vector, and a variety of ecological factors. The presence of A. darling larvae was found to increase with the presence of secondary growth, algae, and large ponds (such as fish farms). These findings support the hypothesis that a cycle of deforestation, land abandonment and secondary growth increases the prevalence of A. darling and the risk of malaria. The authors suggest that educating local populations and promoting sustainable agriculture might reduce the risk of malaria.</p>

Empirical evidence of the public health benefits of tropical forest conservation in Cambodia: a generalised linear mixed-effects model analysis. The Lancet Planetary Health 1:e180–e187.</b> Researchers evaluated if deforestation was correlated with public health by investigating the prevalence of diarrhea, respiratory infection, and fever in children. Researchers found that protected land areas were associated with lower rates of these illnesses in children. There are several reasons deforestation may contribute to lowered standards of health. For example, deforestation has been associated with disrupted water cycles that introduce a greater number of microbes into drinking water. Deforestation can also create favorable conditions for mosquitos that serve as vectors, and the smoke created during the deforestation process can lead to respiratory issues. Researchers concluded that while protected land areas exhibit greater public health, this is not necessarily due to the prevention of deforestation. Protected areas may have other factors that independently influence public health such as less exposure to zoonotic diseases and stabile land access that improves socioeconomic conditions.</p>

T. da Rosa. 1997.</b> Origins of dengue type 2 viruses associated with increased pathogenicity in the Americas. Virology 230:244–251. The dengue virus can cause dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. Dengue fever produces flu like symptoms while dengue hemorrhagic fever causes hemorrhagic disease and can result in death. Dengue hemorrhagic fever has recently been spreading in South America. Previous research has shown that the more severe form of dengue is caused by type two Dengue viruses. Researchers examined phylogenetic data of virus strains isolated from South America and compared them to virus strains from Southeast Asia. They found that Dengue virus type 2 was likely first introduced to the Americas from Southeast Asia in the 1980 Cuban epidemic. After 1989, samples from Brazil, Columbia, Mexico and Venezuela show evidence of dengue type 2 viruses related to Southeast Asian strains. Since its introduction into the Americas, the Southeast Asian strains has displaced native South American strains as the dominant genotype. Researchers concluded that two genotypes of type two dengue viruses originated in Southeast Asia and are responsible for the surge of Dengue Hemorrhagic fever in the Americas. They suggest that using weakened type two viruses from Southeast Asia will likely produce an effective vaccine.</p>

Evolutionary enhancement of Zika virus infectivity in Aedes aegyptimosquitoes. Nature 545:482–486.</b> Phylogenetic analysis of the Zika virus has shown that there are African and Asian lineages. The Asian linage is responsible for the recent major outbreaks in the Americas. Researchers compared Asian Zika strains from Cambodia in 2010 (pre-epidemic) to three post-epidemic South American strains and determined that the post-epidemic strains had higher NS1 secretion rates. This higher secretion rate is due to an alanine to valine substitution in the NS1 protein. Researchers determined NS1 likely gained secretability when Zika migrated from Asia to the southern pacific islands. Experiments showed this mutation generates higher NS1 antigenaemia and increases the transmission rate from mice to mosquitos. Since African lineages also have the alanine to valine substitution, researchers hypothesized that other factors may be preventing human outbreaks from those strains. Researchers concluded that the NS1 mutation has allowed human to mosquito transmission to occur more efficiently and has contributed to the recent outbreaks of Zika virus in the Americas. </p>
